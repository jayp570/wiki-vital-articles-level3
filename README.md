The 10,000 Wikipedia Vital Article Titles

The [10,000 Wikipedia Vital Articles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Vital_articles) are a list compiled by Wikipedia users of the top and most necessary articles on the site from all topics. There are several levels with a different number of articles per level. Level 3 has 10,000.

I noticed a severe and distinct lack of a nice plaintext version of the list: just plain and simple article titles. So, I made it.
